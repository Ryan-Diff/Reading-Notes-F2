## Styling HTML Forms

### directory and set up
* set up your directory with the correct files and format your HTML with the correct elements 
* Do basic styling to make sure your form is linked to CSS and use simple tricks to set up the form to look nice.

### radio buttons
* use your own img for a radio button
* hide the existing radio circles
* put your new check boxes on in a separate `img` folder
* do some css pseudo classes and selectors to change the radio button image and font color when a radio button is selected


### Text Inputs
* using `feildset` in HTML adds some cool style to the form
* give elements their own space, and especially when there is an img
* `border-radius` is nice
* did pretty much the same stuff as before

### Select Boxes
* browsers apply their own default styles to HTML elements
* `box-shadow` is really cool when it is used subtly


### Validation Styles
* using a `<span>` with a class tick is a good way to add a little check mark when a input is validated
* I like the really subtle changes that the form does when something is validated
