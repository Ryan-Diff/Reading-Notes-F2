## Node js

    * Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library

    * Offers speed and scalability

    * Allows for productive development, ie sharing code between the server and client. 

    * Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else.

    * Node.js is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.
