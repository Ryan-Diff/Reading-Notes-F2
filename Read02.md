# Applying Atomic Design

    * Organisms are large sections that we can easily extract from the page. 

    * For each Organism you can further divide into Molecules. 

    * Atoms include basic HTML elements like forms, tables, inputs, buttons and other elements that cant be broken down further. 
# Steps

    * Split the page design into large sections — Organisms
    * Next, divide your Organisms into Molecules, Look out for sections that are repeated frequently
    * Then, Extract your atoms from the Molecules. Remember elements that can’t be broken up any further

# Part Two

    * Start small and work your way up when building, start big and go smaller when vidually breaking down a design. 

    * We split the page design visually into components

    * Next, we structured our folder to follow a 
    consistent pattern

    * Then, we built out the components starting from the atoms, and we worked our way up to the organisms.

# Callbacks

    * Simply put: A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function (normally asynchronous) has finished executing — hence the name ‘call back’.

    * More complexly put: In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument and subsequently called by the function that receives it, is called a callback function.

    * A JavaScript function is a block of code that will be executed when you call it.

    * Because JavaScript functions are first-class objects, you can pass functions to other functions as variables.

    * The method of passing in functions as parameters to other functions to use them inside is used in JavaScript libraries almost everywhere.

    * A JavaScript Callback Function is a function that is passed as a parameter to another JavaScript function, and the callback function is run inside of the function it was passed into.

    * JavaScript Callback Functions can be used synchronously or asynchronously.
