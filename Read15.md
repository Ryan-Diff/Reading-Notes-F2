## Diversity in Tech

    I had always been curious why more men were in tech than women, as a boy who adored video games I didn't understand why more girls weren't into them as my friends and I. <br>
    I remember playing Halo at my friend house with girls over and they kind of seemed disinterested I assumed it had to do with the girls being more mature than us boys and that we would grow out of video games soon.<br>
    That didn't turn out to be the case, I still love playing games and those girls that I am aware of still don't care about tech.<br>
     I never assumed or had an inclination that I was directly being marketed to as a young boy, that video games were just a part of being a boy. <br>
     Diversity in tech makes so much more sense than it being male dominated and white washed. <br>
     Tech companies provide solutions to human problems and to narrow those solutions down to a particular niche doesn't make much business sense. <br>
     The more diverse a company the broader their reach can be to more of the population which in turn means more revenue for the business. <br>
     I have always appreciated diversity, being from Baltimore diversity was all I knew. <br>
     Being raised by a single mother I never really internalized traditional gender roles.<br>
      My Mother was both my Father figure as well as a Mother. <br>
      I think we as a society are starting to realize those roles are archaic and if someone has an interest in a field they should pursue it no matter their race gender or identity.
